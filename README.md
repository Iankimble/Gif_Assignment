# Gif_Assignment

Regretably I was not able to complete this assignment. 

I registered with the giphy page and got an API key. I believe that was written correctly. 

I tried to make a function that when the page was clicked would dynamically generate buttons from the array that I had. I am aware that I was missing some steps

my tutor helped me allot with this assignment but becuase of time constaints I could not complete it in time. 

I understand AJAX and API's at a very superficial level but I haven't practiced it enough to be comfortable and code with confidence. I intend on going over this assignment in my spare time so that I can have a wokring understanding of the concepts.
